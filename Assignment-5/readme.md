# 🎨 Creative Artwork Generation using Stable Diffusion

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of **Stable Diffusion**, a state-of-the-art text-to-image generative model, to create creative and high-quality artwork based on textual prompts. The implementation was carried out using **Google Colab** with GPU support as part of a **Generative AI / Diffusion Models assignment**.

Due to limitations in directly rendering executed Google Colab notebooks on GitHub, the outputs of the notebook are presented here using **generated image screenshots**.

## 🧠 What is Stable Diffusion?

Stable Diffusion is a **latent diffusion model** that generates images from text prompts. Instead of operating directly on pixel space, it performs the diffusion process in a compressed **latent space**, making it computationally efficient while maintaining image quality.

Key components include:

* CLIP Text Encoder
* Latent U-Net
* Scheduler
* Variational Autoencoder (VAE)

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Creating digital artwork manually is time-consuming and requires artistic skills. There is a need for an automated system that can generate visually appealing images efficiently using natural language descriptions.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

We use a **pre-trained Stable Diffusion v1.5 model** to generate creative artwork from text prompts. The model takes a user-defined prompt and produces a high-resolution image without requiring any additional training.

---

## ⚙️ System Workflow

1. User provides a text prompt
2. Text is converted into embeddings using CLIP
3. Random Gaussian noise is generated in latent space
4. U-Net progressively removes noise based on text conditioning
5. Scheduler controls the denoising steps
6. VAE decodes latent representation into a final image

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Used

The architecture consists of:

* **Frozen CLIP Text Encoder** – Converts text to embeddings
* **Latent U-Net** – Core denoising network
* **Scheduler** – Controls diffusion steps
* **VAE Decoder** – Converts latent output to image
